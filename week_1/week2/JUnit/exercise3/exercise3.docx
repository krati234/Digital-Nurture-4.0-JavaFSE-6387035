Exercise 3 Assertions in JUnit Solution

Objective:
Use various JUnit assertions to validate test results.

Scenario Validating Logic with Different JUnit Assertions
You need to write a test class that demonstrates the use of different types of assertions provided by JUnit.

Steps:

Make sure your project is set up with JUnit refer to Exercise 1 if not.

Create a new test class named AssertionsTest.java under src/test/java.

Use the following code:

import static org.junit.Assert.*;
import org.junit.Test;

public class AssertionsTest {

    @Test
    public void testAssertions() {
        // Assert that the sum is equal to expected value
        assertEquals(5, 2 + 3);  // Passes because 2 + 3 == 5

        // Assert that a condition is true
        assertTrue(5 > 3);       // Passes because 5 is greater than 3

        // Assert that a condition is false
        assertFalse(5 < 3);      // Passes because 5 is not less than 3

        // Assert that an object is null
        assertNull(null);        // Passes because the value is indeed null

        // Assert that an object is not null
        assertNotNull(new Object());  // Passes because a new object is not null
    }
}

Explanation of Assertions Used

assertEquals(expected, actual) Verifies that two values are equal.

assertTrue(condition) Verifies that a condition is true.

assertFalse(condition) Verifies that a condition is false.

assertNull(object) Verifies that an object is null.

assertNotNull(object) Verifies that an object is not null.

Expected Output
All assertions pass. Test result will be green.
